# Running Buddy

For the second week I sewed the LEDs on the fanny pack, and mounted the buzzer to the pack. I didn't create the 3D printed case for the board yet, so instead the board is taped on the pack. The wiring is set up for communicating with the LEDs and running the buzzer, but the software for these two actions is not set up yet. On the software side, I created a high-pass filter for getting the number of steps. The steps are displayed on the screen. I also added logic to use the accelerometer to get the direction the user is turning in, which uses the same type of filter. The rotation results are not super reliable, so in the final version I will not be including this functionality. Below is a video showing what I made.
